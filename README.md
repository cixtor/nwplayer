# NWPlayer

Desktop and web application to watch videos from major websites and saving the history in a local database. Check the history, video information, related videos, playlists, avoid ads in the interface and take control of your stats without affect your browsing.

It was initially developed on top of [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) and rewritten into [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) and [Sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3) to improve the performance. The goal is to have this application running over a [Node-Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) instance, but while the support for _SQLite_ is finished the application will run in a browser through this _URL_ [LocalHost 3000](http://localhost:3000/) and optionally through a mini-browser powered by _Python_, _GTK_ and _Webkit_.
